## Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to detect and classify **brain tumors** from MRI images. The model is trained on MRI datasets and can classify tumors into multiple categories accurately.  

This project is built using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras**, and provides both notebook exploration and production-ready scripts for inference.

---

## Features
- Detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans.
- Pre-trained CNN model for faster inference.
- Web application (`app.py`) for real-time predictions.
- Support for Docker deployment (`dockerfile`).
- Visual explanations of model predictions via HTML outputs.
